minikube

Upon using minikube to test out basic kubectl commands, i found it would often lag if left unattended.
The only wy i could resolve this is by deleting.uninstalling mini kube and then reinstalling it.
I then wanted to test some of the git commands i have been looking over and created this as an example.

- note - there will be two files with enlisted code that will then be pushed and merged with main repo Î©
